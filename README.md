<h1 style="text-align: center">Java Game Collection</h1>

Welcome to the Java Game Collection repository! This repository serves as a compilation of console-based Java game scenarios developed to practice coding skills learned during my learning journey.

Although these simple game projects are open to further advancements in utilising collections, generics, exception handling, threads, design patterns, and more advanced concepts, they serve as robust showcases. They exemplify my grasp and practical application of Java programming principles across different learning stages.

<h2 style="color: indianred">Notes:</h2>
These console-based Java games were developed at various stages of my Java programming classes, showcasing the concepts learned during each phase.
Their principal purpose is to demonstrate the foundational programming principles that are being covered in the Java SE module of the curriculum.

While these games do not incorporate advanced Java features introduced later in the curriculum, they do serve as practical demonstrations of my 
evolving understanding of core Java concepts as well as the progression of my programming skills throughout my educational journey.
